<p>Typically in the documentation for SQL types, we use &quot;<code>FromSql</code> impls&quot;
as a shorthand for &quot;Rust types that you can use to represent this type&quot;.
For every other type, that means there is specifically an implementation
of the <code>FromSql</code> trait.</p>
<p>However, PostgreSQL does not support transmission of anonymous record
types as bind parameters. It only supports transmission for named
composite types. For this reason, if you tried to do
<code>int_tuple_col.eq((1, 2))</code>, we will generate the SQL <code>int_tuple_col = ($1, $2)</code> rather than <code>int_tuple_col = $1</code> as we would for anything
else.</p>
<p>This should not be visible during normal usage. The only time this would
affect you is if you were attempting to use <code>sql_query</code> with tuples.
Your code would not compile in that case, as the <code>ToSql</code> trait itself is
not implemented.</p>
<p>We do intend to provide an impl that can be used as a basis for named
composite types in the future, but there is no way for Diesel to
actually support a <code>ToSql</code> impl for anonymous record types.</p>
